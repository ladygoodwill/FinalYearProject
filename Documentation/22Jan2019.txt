Following the tasks from the previous day;

REVIEW:
Ad. 1.
Simple Sequence Diagram was created, might need review while developing the program.

Ad. 2
Charts are created, basics how to manage them are more or less taught. There is need for further work once
the data collection and prediction mode will be set up.



=========================================================================================================
New Tasks TO DO
=========================================================================================================

1. Set up the way the recipes will be collected for specific mode. You can write draft, plan, whatever
- just make up the right way to do so.

2. You must code the BMI data. It is no use for machine learning algorithm here as program is already overloaded with
information and it tends to slow down tremendously.
Pick the data from the user.
Calculate current BMI basing on data taken from SQL dbs, as we assume there will always be accurate and up to date.
After calculating place the data to the right field in User Settings.

3. Create a file which will automatically record all the user weight inputs on daily basis.
Format could be .csv as follows:
DATE | WEIGHT
22/01/2019 | 67
23/01/2019 | 66

etc.
These data should be recorded to this file each time user inputs his or her data.
To prevent repeating - it is much better to write just 2 methods, one to set up the file and 
to give it a header, second to add new values.
It might be needed new method which will rewrite the last result if user will make a mistake and would like to adjust it.
