WHAT WAS DONE?

Ad. 1
The method calculating BMI was coded. The result is outputted in BMIBox.

After a training course upon the machine learning algorithms it has been acknowledged that 
using classification algorithm actually is not a bad idea depending on the way how it will be implemented.
It is something still on a list things-to-do.

**IMPORTANT REMARK**
There are too many lines of code which are not helping in quicker finding right information.
And also, the designer part prevents from deleting the methods which are not of the usage.


Ad. 2

The methods for creating file and appending initial information was created.
Still there is a question how to reuse this method with every next input taken by the user.

==============================================================================================================================
*1.
Code Classification Algorithm and Add initial data to it so machine learning part using the supervised algorithm
could classify if user should go on a diet or not. This information should be outputted in form of label,
with assigned text to it. It might be a method coded and reusing ML code with return stringm which then will be 
passed to the appropriate part of screen (RED OR GREEN). Difficult chunk of job but not impossible.

2. If user should go on a diet then there should be calculated the middle threshold of expected BMI (middle value),
then desired weight should be calculated and also the weight to loose, which should be outputted in the box.
Clearly there is needed a method for that in WelcomeScreen. Bear in mind, this value will like to change!

3. After that user should have possibility to change a diet mode. There should be 3 paces, fast, medium, slow.
Some calories will be assigned to these modes, depending on this is a man or woman.

*4. After changing mode, the recipes should be chosen based on the number of calories and if user is fe/male 
or vegetarian. These should be outputted in form of buttons. By clicking button Breakfast user should see the breakfast
recipe for next day. It should be also opportunity to save it as .pdf file or to print it.
This is a challenging task.

5. user should have opportunity to update his/her weight. Only once and only last result should be amended from a list.
Daily updated weight should be recorded to dbs and to the .csv file.

6. Chart showing how the user's weight is changing probably weekly, showing week progress. Not too easy to code but doable.
Using data from .csv file with dates and weights, like every 7th.

*7. Chart predicting the weight drop within few months could be mocked. It should use the linear regression algorithm to estimate
how it will be changing weekly within one month. Again, coding of this functionality and using the ML code will be challenging
As well as operating the chart.

8. Code clean-up.

9. Testing (???)

10. Working upon documentation.
