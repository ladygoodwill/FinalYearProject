Ad. 1
- minimum calories for women should be 1200, for men - 1500
- the max no of calories regardless someone is vegetarian or not is 1995; for men and women
- therefore there should be defined limits such as:

WOMAN
fast pace: 1200 - 1450 daily
medium pace: 1450 - 1750
slow pace: 1750 - 1900

MAN
fast pace: 1500 - 1600
medium pace: 1600 - 1800
slow pace: 1800 - 2000

How to code it?
Solution A: Or to set up safe boundaries on no of calories to be taken daily
Solution B: Or to make up such algorithm which will allow to pick only those meals which altogether will fulfill the conditions

There will not be too many variations of the recipes sets due to not too high number of different recipes.

Q: How am I going to input so much text in so small space? Maybe best idea is to use that field to create extra button
which will transfer to the new windows where the recipes will be outputted?

They are also going to be printed (or send via email in a form of file?)

Further work is needed upon defined tasks.

1. You must code the BMI data. It is no use for machine learning algorithm here as program is already overloaded with
information and it tends to slow down tremendously.
Pick the data from the user.
Calculate current BMI basing on data taken from SQL dbs, as we assume there will always be accurate and up to date.
After calculating place the data to the right field in User Settings.

2. Create a file which will automatically record all the user weight inputs on daily basis.
Format could be .csv as follows:
DATE | WEIGHT
22/01/2019 | 67
23/01/2019 | 66

etc.
These data should be recorded to this file each time user inputs his or her data.
To prevent repeating - it is much better to write just 2 methods, one to set up the file and 
to give it a header, second to add new values.
It might be needed new method which will rewrite the last result if user will make a mistake and would like to adjust it.
