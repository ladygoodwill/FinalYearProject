Heat a large skillet to medium/high heat. Then grease with olive oil or cooking spray.

Pour eggs onto heated pan and use a spatula to scramble until fully cooked. Set aside.
Roasted Potatoes

First, preheat oven to 400ºF and place a piece of tin foil on a baking sheet.
Prep potatoes by cubing into small chunks. Then place on baking sheet.
Drizzle on 1-2 tablespoons of olive oil and season with paprika, garlic powder, and salt and pepper.
Use hands to toss to make sure everything is evenly coated.
Roast for 30 minutes at 400ºF. Toss half way through. Set aside.
Breakfast Sausage

Heat 1/2 tablespoon of olive oil in a large skillet to medium/high heat.
Then, finely dice 1/2 a white onion and add to skillet along with 1/2 tablespoon minced garlic. Sauté for about a minute before adding breakfast sausage.
Use a spatula to sauté until fully cooked. Set aside.
Burritos

First, heat tortillas for a few seconds in the microwave (this will help with the folding process).
Then, get building! Add scrambled eggs, roasted potatoes, breakfast sausage, and a sprinkle of cheese on top of your tortilla. You should make around 10-12 burritos.
Make your burritos by folding two sides in and then rolling.
Tightly wrap each burrito in tin foil, making sure there are no pockets of air. Then, write the name and date on each burrito for later!
To Reheat

If heating from frozen, unwrap and place on a plate and then into the microwave. Use the defrost setting on your microwave for 2 to 3 minutes, flipping every minute. Then microwave on high for 60-90 seconds or until hot.
